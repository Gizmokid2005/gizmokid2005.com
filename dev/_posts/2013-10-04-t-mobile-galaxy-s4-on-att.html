<p>I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 from T-Mobile. I liked the fact that they have an unlocked boot loader and I am trying to cut down on my outrageous phone bill. One thing that was a requirement was that the device had to work with AT&amp;T's 4G &amp; LTE bands in case T-Mobile didn't have all of the coverage that AT&amp;T did. So I did a comparison of specs between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile as shown below.</p>

<p>Turns out they're basically the same hardware. Sadly, T-Mobile's coverage isn't as good as AT&amp;T's is so I had to swap back in my AT&amp;T SIM card. I can confirm from actual usage that AT&amp;T's service works GREAT on the T-Mobile Galaxy S4!</p>
<p>I did have a bit of trouble getting the service to work entirely, AT&amp;T wasn't the most willing to help, so below are the APN settings you'll need to get your phone working correctly.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Name:</strong> ATT PTA (This can be whatever you want)</p>
<p><strong>APN:</strong> pta</p>
<p><strong>Proxy: </strong>Not Set</p>
<p><strong>Port: </strong>Not Set</p>

<p><strong>MMSC: </strong>http://mmsc.mobile.att.net</p>
<p><strong>MMS Proxy:</strong> proxy.mobile.att.net</p>
<p><strong>MMS Port:</strong> 80</p>
<p><strong>MCC: </strong>310</p>
<p><strong>MNC: </strong>410</p>
<p><strong>Authentication Type</strong><strong>: </strong>Not Set</p>
<p><strong>APN Type:</strong> default,mms,supl,hipri</p>
<p><strong>APN Protocol:</strong> IPv4</p>
<p><strong>APN Roaming Protocol: </strong>IPv4</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy your T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S4 on AT&amp;T!</p>
