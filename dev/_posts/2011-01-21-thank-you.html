<p>I'm a bit late, but this post needs to be out there. I just wanted to extend a huge thank you to everyone who helped and passed the word along about my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-12-03-a-family-in-need %}"><em>A family in need</em></a> post. I was able to gather enough to give the family a boost to their Christmas.</p>

<p>Here's what Angela had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Michael just wanted to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas :)  Please pass this on to all the people who have helped us make our day  very special for Jason me and the kids...... To everyone who thought  about us, to everyone who prayed for us , to everyone who donated or  couldn't and still thought about our family. I want to thank you and my  family thanks you very  very much . We were able to buy food and things  that we needed for everyday life upon getting special things for the  kids that helped make this day a special very non stressful day because  of everyone's help we had a truly awesome day. Please be safe and please  have a wonderful  Merry Christmas I know we did.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a few pictures for everyone:</p>
