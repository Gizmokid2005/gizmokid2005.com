<p>This can be an infuriating error if you ever run into it, largely this post applies to Windows 7 (and equivalents) and above.</p>

<p>Running into the above error when trying to activate an installation of windows, especially if it's a volume license/enterprise edition, can be mind boggling and not make any sense.</p>
<p>I recently got a new machine at work and installed our Enterprise edition of Windows 8. It turns out we don't have the auto-activation file in our ISO so during the installation the appropriate key wasn't used and activated properly.</p>
<p>Thankfully there is an easy way to get around this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt (WIN+R, type "cmd", ENTER)</li>
<li>Type "slui.exe 0x3" and hit enter.</li>
<li>This should open the Key entry GUI to allow you to enter your key and activate windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps anyone who's run into it!</p>
