<p>My story with ManobanWeb's Hosting service</p>
<p>This is a lengthy story about my recent experience with ManobanWeb (http://manobanweb.com) (MBW).  I believe everyone should read this as a warning about this company.  Now I'm not saying that this is a bad company as they've been great up until now, but this is something I hope nobody ever goes through so I am going to document it here.  Enjoy.</p>
<p>(This is going to be exactly as the ticket is with them, with the exception that I removed any personally identifying information, and anything that could be used harmfully, ie - the phishing scripts that I showed them.  I'll give a quick summary at the end).</p>

Guys, I need help, bad and fast.</p>
<p>I went to login to my FTP and cpanel today to upload some files, and couldn't get in. My password had been reset to a random character password again....also, my last login was from 41.191.108.130, which is most certainly not my IP address, in fact it traces to Nigeria somewhere.</p>
<p>Can you help me figure out what happened? And if any files were changed before 5/19/2009 @ 1355 (9:55am EDT). I'm kinda worried this time...something happened and I'm not sure what.</p>
<p>Thanks guys.<br />

Hello,</p>
<p>I will now look into this and block that IP range from our network.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>

D.C.,</p>
<p>Thanks. There seems to be some router interface hosted at that IP and from what I can see on there, either they are some type of hosting company or have a major pipe to the internet for something...looks like 30M/s in bandwidth pretty consistently.</p>

Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I am currently in-touch with the African Network Information Center which is where the IP is being used. If I could ask you to please change all your passwords to avoid them getting into your account again.</p>

It looks like it was about 3:20AM EDT that they were in my hosting. They uploaded two files (both to the public_html folder):<br />
internalrev.php<br />
irs.gov.coookies287484.html</p>
<p>Looks like they are trying to use my domain for phishing...<br />

Here's the good data you'd need from the php file, it's a hacker file, just to get data about bank logins and whatnot, and here contains the email address and whatnot:</p>
<p>"------------ALAFONSO-Hacker from DARK--------------<br />
<PHP REMOVED></p>
<p>SEE the actual php file for more info. I'm going to move the files to the root of the account, out of the public_html folder so they can't be used anymore.<br />

Guys - I have uploaded the file back to my site, modified. Please leave this one on my site until we can figure out more. I have removed all of the code and script from the file.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p><strong><em>*****[NOTE:  I modified the html file with the following text:<br />
I AM NOT THE ONE THIS ORIGINATED FROM!!  I AM A VICTIM TOO!!<br />
If you are here, I am TRULY very sorry for the email you were sent.  This was blatant hacking of my site and files.  If you have reached this page, I have stopped you from giving away your identity to a hacker.  If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  REMEMBER!!  ALWAYS check the URL of your links!!  You NEVER know what you are clicking on.  If the IRS has money to give you, they will NOT email you to say you have money.  EVER.<br />
If you were unfortunate enough to have made it to this page BEFORE I got this page up, PLEASE contact ALL of your banking institutions, and credit bureaus and let them know that you gave away all of your information.  It would also be wise to contact the FBI and let them know the same.  I have already contacted the email provider of the address this info was sent to, as well as my hosting company to find the originating person.<br />
I'm sorry to anyone who's clicked this, and if you've made it here, please forward the email you got with this link to your email provider as a phishing scam.<br />

<p>I am still awaing a reply from the IP provider who the hacker used. I am doubtful that we will catch him as most hackers will mask their IP's.<br />
We have set-up a new firewall on the server which went online earlier today, which should help keep some of them from hacking into accounts.</p>

Dear Michael,</p>
<p>If you check the forum you will see we are in the middle of securing another server which will be made public within the next 48 hours. This server has been completly locked down and we have set up a number of checks to run daily. If you would like I can ask one of the techs currently working on the new node to transfer your account within the next two hours.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I have been checking node2 and have noticed some issues that need fixing. I have now started moving 50% off accounts on node2 over to our newer node.<br />
This is will stop the High CPU usage and should help relieve your account problems. As the list is rather large and most accounts are 2 - 3 GB it will take some time.</p>
<p>I will update this ticket as soon as your account has been transfered.</p>
<p>-- New Nameservers --<br />
NS3.MANOBANWEB.COM<br />
NS4.MANOBANWEB.COM</p>
<p>Login details can be reset on request. Once your account has been transfered you can access it by going the the following IP: <IP removed></p>

A.H. &amp; J.A.,</p>
<p>Thanks for the help. Sorry about the remark, I was just getting frustrated by this. Its just a bit irritating to deal with issues like that, especially when it blacklists my site on places such as http://mywot.com.</p>
<p>I want to thank all of you for being so transparent on the issue and not just covering it up with generic BS like a lot of places would.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to change my A records for my website now too aren't I, considering the IP changed? Do you have this rsynced also, or are any changes that were made on the old server after the move not transferring over?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

PLEASE delete that record. I didn't check to make sure they didn't add any DNS. that's from the latest phishing scam that was added.</p>
<p>As my DNS isn't hosted with you, I have to repoint my A records to the new IP for node1 correct?<br />

Thanks Jake!</p>
<p>Are the files rsynced from the old server (ahoban) to the new one (node1) or are any changes made to the old server that I''m currently on going to be lost on the new one? (I don't think there are many except for maybe in the /public_html/files/portableapps/ folder).</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>The files were transfered last night which was just before I updated the ticket. any files uploaded after that time may be lost.</p>
<p>I have recently been in your account under the IP <IP Removed>, I have cleared all visable illegal files including a number of paypal sites and also a few email scripts that are not allowed on the server. The Email scripts were a form clearly used for sending spam.</p>

<p>Thanks. I'm not worried about anything else then. I kept looking for files that may have been not allowed, but the only folder I saw yesterday was the paypal folder and it disappeared when I was trying to move it out of the public domain for you guys. Thanks for the help Jake.</p>

First off, I don't know what you guys did with the rest of this ticket....second, it's happened AGAIN! This time they didn't log into my cpanel though...here's the link:</p>
<p><ACTUAL URL REMOVED></p>
<p>The FTP password issue needs to be solved. ASAP. If it's not being FTP'd onto my server, then it's something within your security.....This has to stop. I'm on the new "more secure" server and this is the THIRD phishing attempt from my site in the last week...</p>
<p>This needs to stop. You guys have to figure out what is going on and stop it.</p>
<p>/public_html/images/on is the folder these files are in...THEY HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE 5/18/09....which means they weren't taken off when the account was cleaned up before by Jake either.</p>
<p>Guys, PLEASE FIX THIS!!</p>
<p><strong><em>*****[NOTE:  At this point, they had deleted over half my ticked from 5/21 - 5/25 in the server move they did...but I requested it back later, you'll see the entry in the ticket and pasted back in chronological order here.  END NOTE]*****</em></strong><br />

Michael,</p>
<p>In regards to the files in which you found. I know J.A. did a general check and removed most visable content. We have never seen them hide their files in the images folder before so I'm guessing thats why it was missed.<br />
We have configured this node for secure usage, changing SSH ports, new firewalls etc...</p>
<p>Can you please just confirm the last date you believe files were uploaded on, so I can check the logs and compare them to the old server?</p>
<p>I have also checked 2 of my personal accounts with passwords longer than 8 letters and it will not let me in without the full thing.<br />
I will open a ticket with Cpanel first thing in the morning, it's 24:00 now and I was in the middle of sleeping before Dan called.</p>

A.H.,</p>
<p>The majority of the files that I had moved were uploaded on the 18th, there were a few more that I'd noticed today that were uploaded sometime yesterday or early today.</p>
<p>Sorry to have you awoken, but this is getting really excessive now. Please let me know as soon as you have more info about the FTP passwords too. At this point, that looks to be the weak point, as there wasn't a new login from cPanel.</p>

This is COMPLETELY unacceptable. I need a call from one of you ASAP. YOU should be the ones to help with the investigation, ESPECIALLY since this did NOT originate from me.

Michael,</p>
<p>We we're in the process of moving our website when that ticket was submitted. Hence why some parts may have been lost. All are however in our email logs for our records.</p>
<p>We have done our best to try resolve this issue without taking action against your account, however at this time we can not afford to have abuse emails coming in every other day from both banks and also our provider.</p>
<p>On another note: we are only having this problem with your account, so it's the security of your account which has been compromised, nothing to do with our server. I have also checked the logs and matched an IP upto your IP address.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>A.H.<br />

I am hereby requesting a copy of this ENTIRE ticket for my records also.</p>
<p>I told you what the issue was, and you failed to resolve it. The eight character FTP password is where the security failure was for sure in the last issue. You probably matched an IP to my address, I MOVED those files OUT of the public eyes AND uploaded COMPLETELY unrelated files in the meantime...</p>
<p>Please fulfill my request for the full copy of this ticket asap.</p>
<p>-Michael<br />

Michael,</p>
<p>The thing we don't understand is how it's only your FTP account that has been affected with this 8 letter password problem...</p>

A.H.,</p>
<p>Thanks for the ticket. I don't either...but that's where the weak point is now...as the last login has been from my IP.</p>

something on your end is blocking my IP.  I can access your site fine<br />

I don't know what to say...maybe it was done without your knowledge.</p>
<p>But my traceroute dies at host.manobanweb.com, that's where I start to time out.  This is something on your network that is preventing a connection to your servers...</p>
<p>I don't know what other proof you want that it's on your network, but my traceroute blatantly shows it dies on your network.</p>
<p>-Michael<br />
=============================</p>
<p>And there you have it, that's the ticket as it stands so far.</p>
<p>Since I have written this, MBW has managed to get my access to their network back up and running so I can access everything again.  They have also unblocked my account and have unsuspended it.  I have heard nothing from the FBI nor any other agency.  I am currently still diligently looking for a new host.</p>
<p>Quick Summary:</p>
<p>Last week on Tuesday, May 19, 2009 I tried to upload files to my website via FTP for a project I was working on, and couldn't log in. I kept getting a password error. I logged into my account at MBW and noticed that my password had been reset to my cPanel hosting manager which in turn manages my FTP password. After I reset my password I was able to login to my FTP, but I noticed that there were some new files in my hosting. Seeing this I logged into my cPanel hosting manager and noticed that the last login was NOT from my IP address, and infact came from an IP address in Nigeria. I IMMEDIATELY reported this incident to MBW in ticket #449209. I told MBW where the files where, actually gave them the content of the files in the ticket so that they had the information, I also moved the files so that they could not longer be accessed via the web. MBW said that they installed a new firewall, and contacted the African Network Information Center regarding this incident. I thought all was fine until a few days later.</p>
<p>On Friday, May 22, 2009 I noticed that there was ANOTHER issue at hand. I logged into my cPanel and noticed the last login was NOT my IP again. I immediately contacted MBW and they said that they are looking into it again. They also said that they are setting up a more secure server and moving my account to it. I had removed the files that I found uploaded again, also letting MBW know what they were and where, AGAIN. They transferred my server over later that day, and said they removed some more files they had found that I missed as well as some DNS entries. At this point I changed my password from an 11 alphanumeric character password to a 31 alphanumeric password to ensure that it wasn't compromised. I did notice that my FTP login only required EIGHT of the 31 characters to login. Just the first eight would allow a login, and anything after that would not matter in the slightest. I let them know that and they seemed to have ignore it. Except for the FTP password issue, I figured at this point they found the issue, and took care of it.  Fast forward to Monday, May 25, 2009. I log into my cPanel and I don't see anything out of the ordinary but I checked my "Recent Visitors" stats again and noticed that there was something new on my site. My account's FTP access was accessed/hacked and more files were uploaded. I noticed in the same directory those files were in there were files added previously on the 19th that nobody had noticed. I move ALL of those files out of the public access area again and let MBW know what was going on. I also reiterated the fact that my FTP was able to login with only the first eight characters of my password and they said that was not normal and they were going to open up a ticket with cPanel to have that looked into. That was the evening of Monday, May 25th. Today, May 26, I received a notification from them that my hosting was suspended and they weren't going to do anything else because the FBI requested my details regarding this incident.</p>
