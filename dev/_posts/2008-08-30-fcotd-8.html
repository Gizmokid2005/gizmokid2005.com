<p>Offy: the case says mobo size can fit is 10x12.5 my mobo is 12 x 8 will that work?<br />
Offy: or can I not flip my mobo around<br />
Michael: offy...think about that<br />
Michael: seriously<br />
Michael: please<br />
Offy: but idk if I can flip the mobo around becasue of the ports or whatever<br />
Michael: just think about it offy<br />
Offy: also it would of been easy for you to say yes or no instead of those 3 lines of stuff<br />
Offy: 4 lines<br />
Michael: the ports on the mobo have to go out the back, as well as the Expansion slots needing to be lined up with the case....<br />
Offy: so I can't<br />
Offy: fuck building computers, so much shit to check for like size and ddr2 ddr3 and stuff like that RAWR</p>
