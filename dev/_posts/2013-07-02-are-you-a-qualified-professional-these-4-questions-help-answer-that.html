<p><strong>-----------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANSWERS:</strong></p>
<p>1 - Correct Answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe, and close the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly complicated way.<br />
------<br />
2 - Did you say, Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant, and close the refrigerator?<br />
Wrong Answer.<br />
Correct Answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your previous actions.<br />
------<br />
3 - Correct Answer: The Elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator. You just put him in there. This tests your memory.<br />
Okay, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your true abilities.<br />
------<br />
4 - Correct Answer: You jump into the river and swim across. Have you not been listening? All the crocodiles are attending the Animal Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.</p>
