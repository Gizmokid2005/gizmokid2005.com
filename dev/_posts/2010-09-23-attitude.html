<p>I didn't write this, but it was shown to me by a teacher in high school. Figured I'd post it again for everyone. Good lesson here.</p>

<blockquote><p>The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>attitude</strong></span> on life. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Attitude</strong></span>, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appreance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church...a home...a school. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>attitude</strong></span> we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>attitude</strong></span>...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Attitudes</strong></span>.</p></blockquote>
