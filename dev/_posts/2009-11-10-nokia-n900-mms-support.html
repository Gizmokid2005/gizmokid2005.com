<p>I heard information about the Nokia N900 not supporting MMS upon launch.&nbsp; I was curious about it so I decided to email their support and ask.&nbsp; I didn't get the kind of response I was looking for, but here it is nonetheless (formatting edited for readability).</p>

I've been looking at the highly anticipated Nokia N900 and came across a feature that is rumored to be missing and was hoping that you could clarify for me.<br />
I read that the N900 will not support MMS at launch.  Can you please clarify/confirm/elaborate??<br />
Thanks!</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is the reply I received from them:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr Michael Secord,<br />
Thank you for e-mailing the Nokia Care Contact Center. We are glad that you are interested with the Nokia N900 as your preferred device.<br />
With regard to your inquiry about the MMS feature on the Nokia N900, we would like to inform you that the N900 do not have MMS feature, because it uses maemo platform, it has a different settings and it is more like an internet tablet.<br />

<p>So as you can see, it's not really a good reply, but one in any case.&nbsp; I'm going to keep pressing the issue and see if I can get better information.</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT****UPDATED****</strong></em></p>
<p>I emailed Nokia back as I wasn't completely pleased with the original response I received:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for the information.<br />
So the N900 will NOT have MMS support at launch.  Are there any plans to<br />
get MMS support in a future update?  If so, is there any kind of timeline?<br />
Thanks again,<br />
