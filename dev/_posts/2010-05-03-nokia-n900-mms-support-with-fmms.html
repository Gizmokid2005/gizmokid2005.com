<p>Following up from my post a long time ago about the Nokia N900 not supporting MMS natively <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2009-11-10-nokia-n900-mms-support %}">here</a>, this post is to elaborate on the state of affairs now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="//talk.maemo.org/member.php?u=24057">frals</a> from <a href="//talk.maemo.org">talk.maemo.org</a> has written an application called <a href="//garage.maemo.org/projects/fmms">fMMS</a>. You can see the announce thread <a href="//talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=39737">here</a>. As of the time of this writing, it currently resides in extras-devel, but it is a very solid application and seems to work very well with minimal issues/configuration. Though, if you do need help, you can follow the help page <a href="//wiki.maemo.org/MMS">here</a>.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
